Technologies to use:
HTML, CSS
Libraries: Bootstrap (the css + js parts of the library), the mini ‘component-library’ from exercise 3.
Build/dev tools: Vite if you want to (but then in Vanilla JS version)
Don’t use JavaScript-libraries like jQuery, React, Vue, Angular etc.

Assignment:
Create a web shop / online store that sells computer books about frontend development.

All the data about the books should be read from JSON that is formatted according to the specifications below:

No data about about books may be hardcoded into HTML, CSS or JS.

The following categories should exist: ‘UX’, ‘HTML’, ‘CSS’ and ‘JavaScript’.

Within each category there should be at least 5 book titles (i.e. at least 20 book titles in total in the shop).

The following book titles should be among the titles “Responsive design with Bootstrap”, “HTML - an introduction”, “CSS - an introduction” and “JavaScript - an introduction”. 
For these titles their should be a description that is a short summary of what you know about the respective area (in around 300 words). 
Do not copy these texts - write them in your own words!
For the remaining books you should use ‘Lorem Ipsum’ text for your description.

There should be a list of all books that you can filter by category, by author and by price interval (one filter at a time) and that you can sort by title (ascending), title (descending), price (ascending) and price (descending), author (ascending) and author (descending).
NOTE: Book list should be displayed in a table with the following columns: title, author, price, category, image.
NOTE: Create a dropdown menu for the filtering and sorting options.


There should a detailed view that you get to by clicking a book in the list.
NOTE: Detailed view should appear as an animated dropdown (slide down) when you click a book in the list.

There should be a buy button that is displayed next to each book, both in the list of books and on the detailed page for a book.
NOTE: Pressing the buy button should add the book to a shopping cart.

There should be a uniqie image for each book.

There should be a shopping cart that you can choose to hide and show as you want. In the shopping the books the user has chosen to buy should be displayed - each row in the cart should show the book title, number of books of that title, the book price and a row sum. Below the last row should be a total sum.
NOTE: The shopping cart should be stored in the browser’s local storage. (You can use the localStorage API for this.)
NOTE: The shopping cart should be displayed in a table with the following columns: title, number of books, price, row sum.
You do not need to implement any “checkout” functionality.

Only use ONE web page (no links between HTML-documents that triggers a hard reload of a new page) - your application will then be a Single Page Application - and use JavaScript to generate all content (apart from if you want a basic structure empty of content inside your HTML-file).
Use Bootstrap to create a responsive design.
Create an open git repository on GitHub for your assignment and commit your code (in small increements) to the git repo. Turn in the link to the git repo in Canvas when you are done.

Grade 3 - requirements
Fullfill all the points above, except 8 (filtering and sorting).
