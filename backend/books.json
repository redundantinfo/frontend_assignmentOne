    "description": "A language made by some guy at Netscape in the 90s. It took him 10 days to write it, which is blatantly obvious when you use it. Node.js was created in 2009 by Ryan Dahl, who was inspired by Google's V8 JavaScript engine. He later apologised for creating it, saying that he had no idea what he was doing. Jokes aside, JavaScript is a great language, and it's used in everything from web browsers to mobile apps to desktop apps. It's also the language that powers a lot of the web.",
